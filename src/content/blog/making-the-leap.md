excerpt: "I spent years in a meaningful career — but it never felt truly mine. Tech was always my passion, but I kept it on the sidelines. Now, with time, support, and a clear goal, I’m finally doing it: studying computer science and chasing the path I should’ve followed long ago."

For the longest time, I’ve felt stuck in my professional life. Not unhappy, just... unstimulated. I’ve had a stable job, a wonderful family, and a pretty good life overall — but not the passion I always imagined I’d find in a career. I’ve realized I want more than just a job. I want to be immersed in a field. I want to strive toward being a professional in something that excites me. I want to do something I truly care about for the rest of my working life.

For me, that passion has always quietly lived in the world of IT and coding.

# A Passion Left Unfollowed — Until Now

Ever since I was a teenager, I’ve been fascinated by computers and technology. But I never followed that path. Why? Partly because I never really thought I could. School was never “my thing,” especially the technical subjects like math or physics. I didn’t do my homework, didn’t care much about grades. I coasted by thanks to strengths in subjects like German and ethics, but deep down, I felt unfit for anything too technical — especially something as math-heavy as computer science.

So instead of chasing that interest, I studied Middle Eastern Studies and Economics in Hamburg starting in 2009. It was a great time. I met incredible people, fell in love with the city, and began my adult life. Life unfolded — I met my now-wife in India, moved to Switzerland, worked first with refugees and later in NGO management. We got married, had two kids. Life happened fast, and I wouldn’t trade any of it.

But somewhere along the way, I stopped listening to that inner voice telling me to follow what I love. Until now.

# The Perfect Storm

Today, I’m in a uniquely fortunate position. Our youngest child is about to start kindergarten, my wife started a fantastic leadership role last year, and my employer is supporting me with flexible hours and the chance to reduce my workload. I now have the time — and the energy — to finally pursue something I’ve put off for far too long.

So I’m doing it: I’m going back to school to study computer science. And I’ve never felt more excited.
<br>
## The Why

It’s not just about learning to code. It’s about the challenge, the creativity, and the satisfaction that comes from solving problems. Coding, to me, feels like building with digital Lego — but better. I love the moments when things click, when logic becomes beauty, and when problems get untangled. It gives me energy. And that’s the kind of thing I want to model for my kids: do what energizes you.

I want to be able to tell them, honestly, “Follow your passion.” But to do that, I need to live it myself.
<br>
## The How

Let’s be real — diving into computer science as an adult can be overwhelming. But I’ve learned to start small and stay consistent. Over the past year, I’ve squeezed in every free moment to learn:

- **HTML & CSS** via FreeCodeCamp
    
- **Python** through Angela Yu’s Udemy course
    
- **Software design basics** from various online sources
    
- **Study prep** with books like _“Fit fürs Studium Informatik”_
    
- **Podcasts** (especially FreeCodeCamp’s) during walks, dishes, or train rides
    

My goal is clear: 
- Get the foundations. 
- Choose a domain that excites me. 
- Get domain expertise. 

And - most important to me: Keep it as practical as possible — hands-on coding, building things, learning by doing.

# A New Chapter

This isn’t just a career change. It’s a mindset shift. I believe everything I’ve done before — from NGO work to project management to parenting — will bring value into this new field. Skills cross over in surprising ways. So no, it’s not starting from scratch. It’s starting from experience, with passion as the compass.

So here I go — a little nervous, but mostly excited. After all, it’s never too late to start chasing what lights you up.
